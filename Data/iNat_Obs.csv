The male succeeds in life by surviving and passing on it's genes, and the latter is made more likely by the bright colouration. Females are more likely to mate with a bright male. Females don't have to worry about being chosen by a mate, and they are very hard to see with mottled brown colouration. Ain't nature wonderful! Clifton Gardens, Sydney Harbour

Today however was the exception as this awesome little fella pulled out the repertoire time and again. With Pete McGee.

""Gone fishing""
They are not called an angler for nothing. They wave their little lure with its worm like bait around hoping for prey to be drawn in ready to feed on the unsuspected prey.

""Gulp""
After a spot of fishing he decided to start gulping in water. It got so bloated it was rolling around in the water. Not sure on why it did this but many species will often look to enlarge themselves as a mechanism of protection so it may well be a defensive move.

""Yawn""
The yawn is an example of how it would open its mouth and look to suck in the prey in an instantaneous motion giving its prey no chance. They are able to ingest large victims compared to their own size this way."
