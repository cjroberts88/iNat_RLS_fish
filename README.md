Code and data for Roberts et al. 2022. 

Many cameras make light work: opportunistic photographs of rare species in iNaturalist complement structured surveys of reef fish to better understand species richness

This anaylsis compares fish diversity and species composition recorded by iNaturalist and Reef Life Survey (RLS) at several Sydney dive sites. The data included here are processed.

The original data can be accessed from iNaturalist (https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/australasian-fishes) and RLS (https://reeflifesurvey.com/survey-data/).
